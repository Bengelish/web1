<h2>Breathe 가사입니다</h2>
<img src="phone.jpg" width="50%">
<p>Never wanted this, never wanna see you hurt.
Every little bump in the road I tried to swerve.
<strong>People <u>are</u> people</strong>, and sometimes it doesn't work out.
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-html5-20110405/" target="_blank" title="html">Nothing we say is gonna save us from the fallout.</a>
And we know it's never simple, never easy,
Never a clean break. No one here to save me.
You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand.</p>

<p style="margin-top:45px;">And I can't breathe without you
But I have to.
Breathe without you
But I have to.</p>

It's two AM.
Feelin' like I just lost a friend.
Hope you know it's not easy, easy for me.
It's two AM.
Feelin' like I just lost a friend.
Hope you know this ain't easy, easy for me.

And we know it's never simple, never easy,
Never a clean break. No one here to save me.

I can't breathe without you
But I have to.
Breathe without you
But I have to.

Breathe without you
But I have to.

I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry
